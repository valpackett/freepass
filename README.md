# freepass [![unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/un-license-green.svg?style=flat)](http://unlicense.org)

The free password manager for power users.

## What's going on?

- A password manager.
- Based on the [Master Password algorithm], generates the same passwords as the Master Password apps.
- But wait, there's more! Why stop at passwords? It generates...
  - [Ed25519] digital signature keys for...
    - [OpenSSH]: Freepass adds private keys directly to a running ssh-agent & exports public keys in OpenSSH format!
    - *TODO* [signify]: Freepass can sign files & exports public keys in signify format!
    - *TODO* [SQRL]
  - Raw 256-bit keys for symmetric ciphers.
  - *TODO* [BIP39]-compatible passphrases.
- Yes, *all* of the above is *derived from your master password and full name*, you can always recover it by entering the same data!
- The generator settings (site names, counters) are stored in encrypted vault files (NaCl secretbox for each entry + AES for the whole file).
- You can also *store* (old) passwords and text in these vault files.
- Every time you save a vault file, its size changes randomly. That's a feature. Some random junk is added to make it a bit harder to count how many passwords you have without opening the file.

## How?

- Freepass is written in [Rust] and uses [libsodium] as the crypto library.
- Very modular code, easy to audit.
- Completely free software: public domain / [Unlicense].
